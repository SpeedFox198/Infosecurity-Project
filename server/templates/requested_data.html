        We've finished creating a copy of your Bubbles account data you requested on {{ date_requested }}. You can still download your files until {{ expiry_date }}. Inside your export you will find a html and json file that will have all your account information. Be sure to keep these files safe as they contain your personal information.
    </p>
    <a href="{{ link }}">Download your files here!</a>

        Thanks,
